    Skywhales have been used in many cultures throughout history for transportation and companionship.
    While all skywhales are highly intelligent, only a few have developed psychic abilities
    to the point that they can communicate with humans.
    Skywhales could probably dominate the entire earth if they wanted to, but they historically prefer a lifestyle of peace among the clouds.

    Around the time that the Mayflower made its maiden voyage to North America, skywhales also brought more settlers across the Atlantic.
    Skywhales were a safer mode of travel, but they moved somewhat slowly compared to seafaring ships
    This picture depicts how some skywhale riders modified their whales for faster travel.<br><br>

    After the invention of the airplane a century ago, skywhales were largely forgotten by humanity.
    Constant use of computers also keeps the average person from seeing natural skywhale mirgration patterns.
    Nevertheless, they continue to be majestic creatures that move about the skies as they please.
    Jacob Whisenant has formed a special bond with the skywhales of the world,
    so the U.N. recently declared all of the world's skywhales to be under his care.<br><br>
