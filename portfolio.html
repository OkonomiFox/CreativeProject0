  <h1>Top 5 Reasons to go on a Date with Jacob</h1>

  <h2 class="reviews">
    1. He has a car
  </h2>
  &nbsp;
  <img class="aboutpage" src="car.jpg" />
  &nbsp;
  <p class="textbox"><br>
    Ahhh yeahhh, look at that fully-functional vehicle!<br>
    That means he will be able to pick you up for a date really easily!<br>
    Also, the front doors don't lock themselves and that forces him to<br>
    open the door for you as if he were a real gentleman!<br><br>
  </p>

  <h2 class="reviews">
    2. He was a missionary
  </h2>
  &nbsp;
  <img class="aboutpage" src="coolmissionary.jpg" />
  &nbsp;
  <p class="textbox"><br>
    He was a rad missionary in Fukuoka, Japan for 2 years!<br>
    He really likes Japan and speaking Japanese.<br>
    This could actually end up being a bad thing if his constant<br>
    comments about Japan and anime bother you.<br><br>
  </p>

  <h2 class="reviews">
    3. He has won Fortnite games!
  </h2>
  &nbsp;
  <img class="aboutpage" src="fortnite.jpg" />
  &nbsp;
  <p class="textbox"><br>
    This is actually a really good thing for you,<br>
    just the fact that he has this picture in the first place ensures that he is a virgin.<br><br>
  </p>

  <h2 class="reviews">
    4. He cut a cat's claws once
  </h2>
  &nbsp;
  <img class="aboutpage" src="cat.jpg" />
  &nbsp;
  <p class="textbox"><br>
    Animal pictures always get points with the girls so here's one of those.<br>
    We think the black and white somehow makes this picture cuter or more meaningful in some way.<br><br>
  </p>

  <h2 class="reviews">
    5. He studies a lot!
  </h2>
  &nbsp;
  <img class="aboutpage" src="studyselfie.jpg" />
  &nbsp;
  <p class="textbox"><br>
    We ran out of reasons to convince you, so here's one of his selfies!<br>
    He doesn't take selfies very often, but he does try to look his best on a daily basis.<br><br>
